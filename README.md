# Projecting_SDMs
Simulation code used to project species distribution models and develop reccommendations.

Code used for Brodie et al., (in prep). Recommendations for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in projections of species distributions. 

# Steps:

1. Create mean spring rasters of environmental projections
2. Operating model: simulation of HMS (albacore), CPS (sardine), and groundfish (sablefish)
3. Estimation models: build species distribution models (GAM, GLMM, BRT, and MLP)

See Brodie et al., for full methods description
